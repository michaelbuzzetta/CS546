        <h3>Take Advantage of the Buffet</h3>
        <p>Pretty self explaitory, when the all you can eat buffet is open, use it to its fullest extent.

        <h3>Be Social</h3>
        <p>You are essentially trapped on a floating tin can in the middle of the Ocean, you may as well take the oppertunity to meet new people.
            Some of my best friends I have, I met on vacations.
